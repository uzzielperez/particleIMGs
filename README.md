# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Particle Classification
## Overview

This repository contains the code for training and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on particle images. The CNN here is designed to classify electrons vs photons. 
The code here is a modified form of the code used in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11916.pdf.
