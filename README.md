# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Particle Classification
## Overview

This repository contains the code for training and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on particle images. The CNN here is designed to classify electrons vs photons. 
The code here is a modified form of the code used in https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1085/4/042022/pdf.
